For running the recommendation

1. Extracting current saved rantings from the movies mongo collection
Inside the folder mapreduce :

- We run the create_input_file.rb script. This will simply generate a fie with line numbers with how many movies we have in the movies collection of mongo.
- Then we run the hadoop_run.sh script. This will generate a file with the form "user|movie|rating"


2. Extract the information from Movie Lens and creating a file with the lovelyromcoms id in the form "user|movie_id|rating"
Inside the folder data_preparation:

- Run movie_lens_to_lovelyromcoms_id_map.rb



3. Then for actually generate recommendations for user:

require_relative 'recommender'
require_relative 'file_ratings_extractor'
extractor = FileRatingsExtractor.new('/Users/cscarioni/projects/lovelyromcoms/lib/utilities/recommendations/mapreduce/data_preparation/recommendation_feed')
similarity = Similarity.new(extractor)
similarity.generate_similarities

recommender = Recommender.new(extractor, MongoBackedSimilarityData.new)

recommendations = recommender.recommendations_for('4f3fee227703d408c0000045')

puts recommendations
