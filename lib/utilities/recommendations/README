For running the recommendation

1. Extracting current saved rantings from the movies mongo collection
Inside the folder mapreduce :

- We run the create_input_file.rb script. This will simply generate a fie with line numbers with how many movies we have in the movies collection of mongo.
- Then we run the hadoop_run.sh script. This will generate a file with the form "user|movie|rating"


2. Extract the information from Movie Lens and creating a file with the lovelyromcoms id in the form "user|movie_id|rating"
Inside the folder data_preparation:

- Run movie_lens_to_lovelyromcoms_id_map.rb



3. Then for actually generate recommendations for user:
