The film also benefits from location shooting in San Francisco, caught in the moonlight-and-supper-club glow of the late '50s. Sinatra does beautifully with the Rodgers and Hart classics \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\" and \"I Could Write a Book,\" and his performance of \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" (evocatively shot by director George Sidney) is flat-out genius. Sinatra's ease with hep-cat lingo nearly outdoes Bing Crosby at his best, and included in the DVD is a trailer in which Sinatra instructs the audience in \"Joey's Jargon,\" a collection of hip slang words such as \"gasser\" and \"mouse.\" If not one of Sinatra's very best movies, Pal Joey is nevertheless a classy vehicle that fits like a glove", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/29/35/293525_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/29/35/293525_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/29/35/293525_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/29/35/293525_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Rita Hayworth", "characters"=>["Vera Simpson"], "image"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/photo/10/06/69/10066901_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Frank Sinatra", "characters"=>["Joey Evans"], "image"=>"http://www.team-renegade-racing.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/team-photos/placeholder.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Kim Novak", "characters"=>["Linda English"]}, {"name"=>"Barbara Nichols", "characters"=>["Gladys"]}, {"name"=>"Bobby Sherwood", "characters"=>["Ned Galvin"]}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"George Sidney"}], "studio"=>"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"0050815"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/18694.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pal_joey/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/18694/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/18694/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/18694/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/18694/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>18694, "trailer"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pal_joey/trailers/10902628", :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4f39363c7703d4079b00000e')}
