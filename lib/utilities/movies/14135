After he sets his sights on the ultra-classy Brandi Web, he launches an all-out assault to win her heart. Ultimately, charm, lust and passion prevail, but Darnell learns the hard way that when you play, you pay. Brandi is much harder to get rid of than she was to get--especially when she realizes that she has a rival vying for Darnell's affection. When he finally decides to call it quits, Brandi becomes an obsessed femme fatale stalking the new love of her life.", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/97/03/07/9703076_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/97/03/07/9703076_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/97/03/07/9703076_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/97/03/07/9703076_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Martin Lawrence", "characters"=>["Darnell Wright"], "image"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/rtactor/40/40/40401_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Lynn Whitfield", "characters"=>["Brandi Web"], "image"=>"http://www.team-renegade-racing.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/team-photos/placeholder.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Regina King", "characters"=>["Mia"]}, {"name"=>"Bobby Brown", "characters"=>["Tee"]}, {"name"=>"Della Reese", "characters"=>["Ma Wright"]}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"Martin Lawrence"}], "studio"=>"New Line Home Entertainment", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"0117891"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/14135.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thin_line_between_love_and_hate/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/14135/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/14135/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/14135/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/14135/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>14135, :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4efccb8083aeaa1b3f000088')}
