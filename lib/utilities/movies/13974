It is a movie about 6 lifetime friends who are all hitting the big `3-0' together during the same year. Each one looks inside themselves to see where has my life gone and what am I going to do with my future. Actually, what I saw was a black Seinfeld comedy. Tracy Morgan, who is one of the main characters, is a struggling comedian just like Jerry Seinfeld. He gives his opinion of what women want in a man in one of his comedy routines. Melissa De Sousa is looking for a man before time runs out. She is just like Elaine in Seinfeld. I don't remember the big problem with turning thirty, however, all the characters in this movie can show you what they are, such as not having fame, riches, a husband, a thin body, and staying young. Their life stories are probably repeated many times around the world.", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/27/23/272398_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/27/23/272398_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/27/23/272398_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/27/23/272398_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Erika Alexander", "characters"=>["Joy"], "image"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/photo/12/93/90/12939009_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Melissa DeSousa", "characters"=>["Natalie"], "image"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/photo/11/52/04/11520494_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Tracy Morgan", "characters"=>["Troy"]}, {"name"=>"Paula Jai Parker", "characters"=>["Stephanie"]}, {"name"=>"Allen Payne", "characters"=>["Maleek"]}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"Vanessa Middleton"}], "studio"=>"Kino International", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"0273048"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/13974.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/30_years_to_life/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/13974/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/13974/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/13974/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/13974/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>13974, :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4efcc77983aeaa1b3f000049')}
