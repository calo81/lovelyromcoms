While Zenobia is still looking for a man, Victoria is married to a man who doesn't want children. Clevon, meanwhile, is too geeky to get a woman, and Phil is already married with children, but his wife is not very interested in being a mother. All four of them try to rectify their romantic lives and futures while their biological clocks tick away. -- (C) Official site", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157253_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157253_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157253_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/15/72/11157253_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Meagan Good", "characters"=>["Falinda"], "image"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/photo/11/41/58/11415854_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Kevin Hart", "characters"=>["Cleavon"], "image"=>"http://www.team-renegade-racing.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/team-photos/placeholder.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Tamala Jones", "characters"=>["Victoria"]}, {"name"=>"Nicole Ari Parker", "characters"=>["Zenobia"]}, {"name"=>"Darius McCrary", "characters"=>["Nick West"]}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"Russ Parr"}], "studio"=>"Image Entertainment", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"1652287"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771236434.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/35_and_ticking/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771236434/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771236434/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771236434/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771236434/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>771236434, :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4efcc78883aeaa1b3f00004a')}
