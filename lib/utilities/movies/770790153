Matty, mother of three, bumps her car into a truck on the parking lot of a supermarket. Johnny climbs down from the cabin. He is infuriated by the dent in his front bumper and yells at Matty. Although impressed by the accident, Matty fights back with sharp words. Their discussion turns into a row, and the police have to intervene. Matty goes home, the trunk of her car dancing up and down. Back in her apartment, Matty takes a hot bath to recover from the afternoon’s emotionswhen the phone rings. It’s Johnny, apologizing for his behaviour on the parking lot. Matty tells him to stay out of her life. A dramatic comedy begins about a woman whose soul is full of dents and bruises.", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/88/97/10889700_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/88/97/10889700_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/88/97/10889700_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/88/97/10889700_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Barbara Sarafian", "id"=>"770735648", "characters"=>["Matty"], "image"=>"http://www.team-renegade-racing.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/team-photos/placeholder.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Jurgen Delnaet", "id"=>"770810367", "characters"=>["Johnny"], "image"=>"http://www.team-renegade-racing.co.uk/wp-content/gallery/team-photos/placeholder.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Johan Heldenbergh", "id"=>"403905701", "characters"=>["Werner"]}, {"name"=>"Anemone Valcke", "id"=>"770810368", "characters"=>["Vera"]}, {"name"=>"Sofia Ferri", "id"=>"770810369", "characters"=>["Fien"]}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"Christophe Van Rompaey"}], "studio"=>"NeoClassics Films", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"0948530"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790153.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moscow_belgium/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790153/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790153/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790153/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790153/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>770790153, "trailer"=>{"image"=>"http://content.internetvideoarchive.com/content/photos/5595/23499007_.jpg", "url"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moscow_belgium/trailers/11097439"}, :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4f817bf483aeaa0ba400003e')}
