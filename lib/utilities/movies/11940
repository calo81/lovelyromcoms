The gangly, unsure youth is first seen at a baseball game, standing at bat, ready for yet another strike out. Suddenly a terrible earthquake hits; as the others run for safety, the ground opens up under Calvin's boots and he falls through the chasm. He falls and falls until he finds himself landing on the head of a 6th-century black knight.
