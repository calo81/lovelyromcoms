During their weekly date night, they impetuously steal a dinner reservation, which leads to a case of mistaken identity. Turns out the reservation was for a pair of thieves, and now a number of unsavory characters want Phil and Claire killed. If they can survive a wacky life-threatening night, they may just rediscover the passion missing from their marriage. Directed by Shawn Levy, the film co-stars Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, and Kristen Wiig. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/93/37/10933732_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/93/37/10933732_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/93/37/10933732_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/93/37/10933732_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Steve Carell", "id"=>"162652665", "characters"=>["Phil Foster"], "image"=>"http://content6.flixster.com/rtactor/40/85/40852_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Tina Fey", "id"=>"427823878", "characters"=>["Claire Foster"], "image"=>"http://content9.flixster.com/rtactor/40/86/40867_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Mark Wahlberg", "id"=>"162653181", "characters"=>["Holbrooke"]}, {"name"=>"Taraji P.
