Academy Award (R) nominee Kate Hudson is joined by Academy Award (R) winners Kathy Bates and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as Gael Garcia Bernal (\"Letters to Juliet\"), Lucy Punch (\"Dinner for Schmucks\"), Romany Malco (\"The 40 Year Old Virgin\"), Rosemarie DeWitt (\"Rachel Getting Married\"), Steven Weber (\"My One And Only\") and Treat Williams (\"What Happens in Vegas\"). The Film is directed by Nicole Kassell (\"The Woodsman\") from an original screenplay by Gren Wells. Marley Corbett (Hudson) is young, beautiful, and wildly funny, but she's afraid of opening herself up to true love and commitment. Though she uses her humor to prevent matters from getting serious, a life-changing visit to her doctor (Bernal) sends both of them on an eye-opening adventure of mutual discovery, leading to revelations neither thought possible.", "posters"=>{"thumbnail"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/40/11164093_mob.jpg", "profile"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/40/11164093_pro.jpg", "detailed"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/40/11164093_det.jpg", "original"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/40/11164093_ori.jpg"}, "abridged_cast"=>[{"name"=>"Kate Hudson", "id"=>"162653218", "image"=>"http://content8.flixster.com/rtactor/40/75/40750_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Lucy Punch", "id"=>"510743072", "image"=>"http://content7.flixster.com/photo/12/60/63/12606389_ori.jpg"}, {"name"=>"Kathy Bates", "id"=>"162660148"}, {"name"=>"Peter Dinklage", "id"=>"162653586"}, {"name"=>"Gael Garcia Bernal", "id"=>"162684026"}], "abridged_directors"=>[{"name"=>"Nicole Kassell"}], "studio"=>"Millenium Entertainment", "alternate_ids"=>{"imdb"=>"1440161"}, "links"=>{"self"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742.json", "alternate"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_little_bit_of_heaven_2011/", "cast"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/cast.json", "clips"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/clips.json", "reviews"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/reviews.json", "similar"=>"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/similar.json"}, "rotten_id"=>771224742, "trailer"=>{"image"=>"http://content.internetvideoarchive.com/content/photos/6981/290631_720.jpg", "url"=>"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_little_bit_of_heaven_2011/trailers/11163254"}, :_id=>BSON::ObjectId('4f817a2c83aeaa0ba4000031')}
